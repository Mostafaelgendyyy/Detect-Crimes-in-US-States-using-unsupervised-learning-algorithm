# Detect-Crimes-in-US-States-using-unsupervised-learning-algorithm
## Data Description:
-	Consider crime dataset in crime_data.csv file, it contains statistics, in arrests per 100,000 residents for assault, murder, and rape in each of the 50 US states in 1973. Also given is the percent of the population living in urban areas.

## Project Requirements:

- Building an un supervised model to group the US states based on the similarity of their crimes. 
- I use k-means algorithm to cluster the states to k clusters 
- Number of clusters (k) will be provided from the user as an input.
- Initial centroid are chosen randomly.
- i use use Manhattan distance as your distance function.
- **I detect outlier data (if exists) and Show it.**
- The final output of your program should show k lists of states and show outlier productâ€™s records.
